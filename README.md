# Starbound-StoredOutfits
A *multiplayer friendly* (UNTESTED) mod that adds custom items which can be used to store and quickly equip outfits.

Uses https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-ItemInterfaces for access to the `player` table by using an invisible `ScriptPane` interface.

Credits to ICDeadPixels for the idea of easily switching outfits through an interface or by other means.
