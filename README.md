# Starbound-StoredOutfits
A *multiplayer friendly* (UNTESTED) mod that adds custom items which can be used to store and quickly equip outfits.

**You probably don't want to try this mod until I remove the simple encryption; it soft corrupts your character.**

Uses https://github.com/Silverfeelin/Starbound-ItemInterfaces for access to the `player` table by using an invisible `ScriptPane` interface.

Uses Caesar cipher to protect the items from theft, though as most coders know that's not really good at protecting from people who *really* want your stuff. It does prevent simple hand item copying from copying the item name, description and directives.

Credits to ICDeadPixels for the idea of easily switching outfits through an interface or by other means.
